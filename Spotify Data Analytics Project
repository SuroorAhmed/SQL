--First, I looked at all the data in the table--
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Q1: Does danceability vary across tempo ranges (e.g., slow vs fast songs)?--
--I looked at the data I was interested in--
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo DESC;

--Then, I summarized and grouped the data to look at the correlation between Tempo and Danceability. I grouped songs into ranges (slow/medium/fast), then calculated the average danceability for each group.--
SELECT 
      CASE 
          WHEN tempo <100 THEN 'Slow'
          WHEN tempo BETWEEN 100 AND 150 THEN 'Medium'
          ELSE 'Fast'
      END AS tempo_range,
      AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability,
      COUNT(*) AS song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata     
GROUP BY tempo_range
ORDER BY avg_danceability DESC; 

--Q2: Which features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.) are most common in popular songs (popularity > 80)?--
SELECT 
    AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability,
    AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS avg_valence,
    AVG(loudness) AS avg_loudness,
    AVG(speechiness) AS avg_speechiness,
    AVG(tempo) AS avg_tempo,
    AVG(duration_ms) AS avg_duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 80;
--Output--
avg_danceability	avg_energy	      avg_valence	      avg_loudness	    avg_speechiness	  avg_tempo	          avg_duration
0.67245238095238	0.64502380952381	0.52024285714286	-5.93316666666667	0.08168571428571	122.14578571428571	200189.92857142858

--These rusults show that the most popular songs aren’t necessarily the happiest, but they are fast, energetic, polished, and just the right length to keep listeners engaged.--

--Q3:Which song is the longest, who is the artist?--
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Q4: What’s the average popularity of all songs in the dataset?--
SELECT AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
